# Mahaan-Jain-ecc-dssb-IS24-code-challenge

This repository contains the code for a web application built with ReactJS, TailwindCSS, AntDesign and NestJs for the IS24-Full-Stack Competition. Made by Mahaan Jain

### Installation
Before running the application, make sure you have Node.js installed on your system. To install the required dependencies, open a terminal and navigate to the root project directory. Run the following command:

`npm run setup`

This command will install all the dependencies required to run the application.

### Start

To start the application, run the following command:

`npm run start`

This will start the server and open the application in your default browser. The frontend can be accessed at localhost:4000, while the backend is available at localhost:3000. To access the Swagger documentation, go to localhost:3000/api/api-docs.

To restart the server, just use the start command, no need to setup the repository again.

### Technologies Used:

#### Frontend:
ReactJS  
TailwindCSS  
AntDesign  

ReactJS is a popular JavaScript library used for building user interfaces. TailwindCSS is a utility-first CSS framework that helps you quickly create custom designs. AntDesign is a UI design language and React-based library that provides a set of high-quality React components.

#### Backend:
NestJs

NestJs is a progressive Node.js framework for building efficient, scalable, and reliable server-side applications. It uses modern JavaScript features and has a modular architecture that makes it easy to develop and maintain large-scale applications.
